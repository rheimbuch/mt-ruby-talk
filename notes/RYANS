Everything is an object
- and mutable, no primitives
- methods can be called directly on literals

Classes
- capital letters
- inherit from object by default
- instantiate with .new, can pass parameters to .new
- Gives us Type Introspection, which means we can ask a class what it is, 
   which you've seen us doing


Classes Execute
- When the interpreter hits a class, it will execute the class top to bottom
- In ruby, there is always an object called self, which points to the class the code is currently in
	and in ruby, you are always in a class
- so if a method gets called without being called directly on an object, we can assume it is called on self
- so here, we're actually calling self.puts, which all classes inherit from the Object object
- You'll see in class method calling a lot in rails to setup things like relations between models



Inheritance
- Inherits with < character
- Multiple Inheritance is done with Mixins
- Polymorphism is supported via method sending


Instance Variables
- uses @ character
- interaction with instance variables is through getters and setters
- you use = in the method name for setters, getters are the instance variable name (typically)


Accessors
- easy way to create getter/setter methods

Modules
- copies methods to a class
- you can access instance variables from within these methods
- also a way to call a pseudoconstructor when a module gets attached to a class

- can be added to a class 2 ways
- include adds instance methods, extend adds class methods
	- this can be a bit confusing, since you'll see instances of a class extended instead of using include
	- You can think of it is as



## BACK TO POL


Installing Ruby
- ruby comes installed on snow leopard
- on ubuntu, you can install from apt-get, otherwise I recommend compiling it from the source
   I think the only requirement is zlib and openssl if you want to use ssl from your code
- on windows, there's an installer someone put together that you can download, just be
    sure to add ruby to your path so you can use it from the command line
